# Symbiodiniaeae_Pump_Iron

Welcome to the github page for the paper "Endosymbiotic dinoflagellates pump iron: Differences in iron and other trace metal
needs among the Symbiodiniaceae" - Hannah Reich, Irene Rodriguez, Todd LaJeunesse, Tung-Yuan Ho. (Coral Reefs 2020). 


Abstract: Iron (Fe) is essential to the physiology and growth of marine phytoplankton. It remains
unclear how important iron is to the functional ecology of symbiotic dinoflagellates in
the family Symbiodiniaceae, and whether limitations in iron ultimately affect the health
and productivity of coral hosts, especially during of episodes of ocean warming. Five
Symbiodiniaceae species (spanning three genera) were used to investigate the effects
of reduced iron availability on cell growth and the acquisition of other trace metals.
When grown under iron replete conditions, intracellular iron quotas (content) reflected
a large biochemical demand and ranged from 7.8-23.1 mmol Fe mol P-1.
Symbiodinium necroappetens was the only species that acclimated and maintained
high growth rates while subjected to the lowest iron treatment (250 pM FeÂ´). Cultures
surviving under low iron concentrations experienced changes in cellular concentrations
(and presumably their use as co-factors) of other trace metals (e.g. zinc, copper,
cobalt, manganese, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium), in ways that were species
specific, and possibly related to the natural ecology of each species. These changes in
trace metal contents may have cascading effects on vital biochemical functions such
as metalloenzyme activities, photosynthetic performance, and macronutrient
assimilation. Furthermore, these species-specific responses to iron limitation provides
a basis for investigations on how iron availability effects cellular processes among
species and genera of Symbiodiniaceae, and ultimately how metal shortages of
modulates the response of coral-algal mutualisms to physiological stressors.
