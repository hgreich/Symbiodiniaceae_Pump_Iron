# log transform the data
# rationale from Quigg et al 2003 "The analysis was performed on Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co and Cd concentrations, normalized to phosphorus and log transformed to homogenize the variances. Each species was represented as a point in six-dimensional space (one dimension for each element). The analysis was performed on the basis of correlations rather than co-variances, giving equal weight to each ratio as opposed to giving more weight to the elements with the larger ratios."
